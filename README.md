Optimization of Radiosurgery in Julia
This project implements an optimization algorithm in Julia to pack circles of varying radii, representing gamma knife shots, within a specified playground contour representing the MRI scan of a tumor. 
The goal is to maximize coverage of the contour area while minimizing the number of circles used, balancing efficiency and coverage to achieve an optimal configuration.
